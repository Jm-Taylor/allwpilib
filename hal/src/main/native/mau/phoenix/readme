This directory contains code/build files to generate a "CTRE Phoenix-compilant platform" shared library.

Purpose:

The purpose of this library is to allow the phoenix library to access the CAN bus interface provided
by the VMX-pi Platform.

Library name:

Following the current phoenix convention, the exact name of this library must be: libCTRE_PhoenixPlatform.so

This library is accessed by the libCTRE_PhoenixCanutils.so file.  Raspbian versions of this library are available at:

  http://devsite.ctr-electronics.com/maven/release/com/ctre/phoenix/canutils/

Other phoenix libraries 

External Dependencies:

  * Phoenix

    This library implements the interface defined in the headers available at:

         http://devsite.ctr-electronics.com/maven/release/com/ctre/phoenix/core/

         Within the <latest_version>/core-<latest_version>-headers.zip file

    These header files are also available via Git checkout from:

         https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix-Linux-SocketCAN-Example

         within the include/ctre directory

Internal Dependencies:

This library is also dependent upon the "Mau" version of the WPI Library HAL, and the underlying VMX-pi platform libraries.

** Usage Dependencies

A WPI library-based application requires the following components to use the CTRE Phoenix platform with the VMX-pi:

    - CTRE_PhoenixPlatform.so (this library)
    - CTRE_PhoenixCanutils.so
        http://devsite.ctr-electronics.com/maven/release/com/ctre/phoenix/canutils/
    - CTRE_PhoenixCCI.so
        http://devsite.ctr-electronics.com/maven/release/com/ctre/phoenix/cci/
    - CTRE_Phoenix.a
        http://devsite.ctr-electronics.com/maven/release/com/ctre/phoenix/api-cpp/
    - CTRE_Phoenix_WPI.a
        http://devsite.ctr-electronics.com/maven/release/com/ctre/phoenix/wpiapi-cpp/

Note that these dependencies (for FRC on the "athena" platform) are documented in the "vendordeps" file at:

    http://devsite.ctr-electronics.com/maven/release/com/ctre/phoenix/Phoenix-latest.json

    (The windows installer also installs that file to this location):

    C:\Users\Public\frc2019\vendordeps\Phoenix.json
